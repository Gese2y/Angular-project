<div mat-form-field>
    Use bootstrap class for
    <span class="d-inline bg-info">display: inline</span>
    to wrap the text inside the element to normally.
  
    While using the property <span class="d-inline-block">display: inline-block</span>
    will wrap the element to prevent the text inside from extending beyond its parent.
  
    Lastly, using the property <span class="d-block">display: block</span>
    will put the element on it's own line and fill its parent.
  </div>
